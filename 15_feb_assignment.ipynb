    "1. MultiProcessing --> In multiProcessing each process has its own memory space. if there is any error occurs in one process does not affect others.\n",

    "2. MultiThreading --> In multiple Threading process share the same memory space. that's why sometime they occur some issues's. if not properly managed.\n",
